<p>The current version of this document can be found at <a href="https://gym-routine-tracker.github.io/privacy/">https://gym-routine-tracker.github.io/privacy/</a>.</p>

<p>At OpenAlloc LLC, we respect your privacy. We believe that the less we know about you and your personal data, the better; that is why we aim to limit the information we collect to the minimum necessary.</p>

<p>This policy applies to all information collected or submitted to OpenAlloc LLC’s website and our apps for macOS, WatchOS, and any other devices and platforms.</p>

<p>For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the terms “OpenAlloc LLC”, “we,” “us” and “our” refer to the company OpenAlloc LLC; the terms “application“, “app”, “service”, and “product” refer to the Gym Routine Tracker software, website, and any related services; and “you” refers to you, as a user of the application as applicable.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to change this policy at any time (and without prior notification), which we will do through online posting.</p>

<h2 id="information-we-collect">Information we collect</h2>

<p>For Gym Routine Tracker, your workout data is stored locally on your device and, when accessible, is synced with your private iCloud account hosted by Apple.</p>

<p>We may collect a limited amount of information that is necessary to improve the app, and to provide support. To help identify and solve specific problems with our products and services, we occasionally solicit diagnostic reports and other troubleshooting, bug, and crash reports from customers.</p>

<p>The website may also store basic technical information, such as your IP address, in temporary memory or logs. If you decide to contact us via email, we receive an email with the details you provided (your email address, the name and the text).</p>

<h2 id="information-usage">Information usage</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to operate and improve our apps, website, and customer support. For instance, we will respond to an email to answer your question or help you fix a problem, but we do not use your email address for marketing purposes or share it with others.</p>

<p>We may disclose your information in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal requirements; to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud or abuse, violations of our policies; or to protect our rights and property.</p>

<p>In the future, we may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with other businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.</p>

<h2 id="security">Security</h2>

<p>We implement a variety of security measures to help keep your information secure.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-changing-or-deleting-information">Accessing, changing, or deleting information</h2>

<p>You can request that we erase any personal data we hold about you, such as that found in support emails. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.</p>

<h2 id="california-online-privacy-protection-act-compliance">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h2>

<p>We comply with the California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to outside parties without your consent.</p>
